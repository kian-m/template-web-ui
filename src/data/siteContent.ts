                answer: "Signs that your child might benefit from tutoring include declining grades, expressed frustration with school work, procrastination on assignments, or simply wanting to excel beyond the classroom curriculum. Many parents in Lafayette, Orinda, and surrounding communities use tutoring to give their children a competitive edge academically."

I understand the academic pressures and expectations in our affluent communities and tailor my approach to help your child excel in these competitive environments."

                answer: "Standard sessions are 60 minutes, but I also offer 90-minute and 2-hour sessions for more intensive study needs. The best duration depends on your child's age, attention span, and learning goals. For advanced placement and college prep students, I typically recommend longer sessions."

            {
                id: "faq-4",
                question: "How often should we schedule sessions?",
                answer: "For most students, weekly sessions provide the right balance of instruction and independent practice. For students who need more support or are preparing for important exams, twice-weekly sessions may be recommended. Consistency is key to seeing improvement."

            {

                answer: "I understand that things come up. I request at least 24 hours notice for cancellations. Sessions cancelled with less than 24 hours notice may be charged a 50% fee. No-shows are charged the full session rate. This policy respects everyone's time and allows me to potentially offer the slot to another student."

If you're ever unsatisfied with a session, please let me know immediately, and we'll address your concerns or adjust our approach."

                answer: "Yes, I offer guidance on course selection and academic preparation to strengthen college applications. Many of my former students have been accepted to prestigious institutions including Stanford, UC Berkeley, MIT, and Ivy League schools. While I don't write essays or complete applications, I help students build the strong academic foundation that makes them competitive candidates."

            {
                id: "faq-8",
                question: "Do you assign homework?",
                answer: "Yes, I typically provide practice problems between sessions to reinforce concepts we've covered. The amount varies based on the student's needs and schedule, but consistent practice is key to improvement in math and physics. I carefully select problems that will be most beneficial to your child's specific learning goals."
